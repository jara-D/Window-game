 # Window game




 ## Plans
- pixelated filter
- player gun
- enemies
- border gets bigger when you shoot it
- change the position of the window when it gets smaller/bigger so it looks like it can change on all sides
- enemy waves. this game never ends actually. (rogelike)
- menus
- score board for the lonely
- funky colors on player, endgame stuff using shaders
